# GI_disease_and_pollution_in_CA
Python code to accompany the paper "Environmental Pollutants are Associated with Irritable Bowel Syndrome in a Cohort of California Residents".

This code reads in census data at the census tract level, rolls it up to the zip code level, and regresses it against the incidence of various GI diseases in California, which were obtained from the Optum Clinformatics dataset.  Optum data is unfortunately private so it cannot be shared.  I am sharing the code for transparency but also for other researchers who want to do geospatial models with census data.
